## Front-End Developer Test: Church Community Builder

Due to time constraints, I omitted certain steps that would optimize the design and User Experience in a production
setting.

# UX Research

I would normally team up with a UX Designer and UI designer to determine the best design and experience for our users.
The iterative steps I would take for the design process can be found at

## Testing and optimization

The app should normally be tested across different platforms and also tested for optimization.

## User interface

Part of the UX Research would be to determine the UI that would deliver the most efficient, usable, and attractive interface.
The UI should be responsive or adaptive.

## App state management

One consideration would be to use redux to manage state
