# Front-End Developer Test

## Overview

Your client has tasked you with making the Ultimate Moviegoers Guide using _The Movie Database API_. They are asking for an app that at least covers the following:

* Shows the user a list of movies where the user can sort by
  * Now Playing
  * Popular
  * Top Rated
* Allows the user to search for a movie
* Allows the user to select a movie and see more details. The more details, the better.

Best of all is the client has given you full creative control.
Make the Ultimate Moviegoers Guide the best looking app out there.
Feel free to use any front-end framework of your choice - React, React-Native, Vue, Vue Native, Angular, Ember etc.

### Keep in mind the following questions

* What design patterns did you use?
* How would you test your application?
* How do you manage/store application state?
* What ways could you structure the code to make it easy to understand and maintain?
* What other considerations and tradeoffs did you make when building the application?

## API

[Sign Up](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) for an account with 'The Movie Database.'

Once you are logged in you can go to _settings_ -> [_api_](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and create an api application.
Make it a personal application. If you do not have a website url, we recommend [creating a free github page](https://pages.github.com/).
